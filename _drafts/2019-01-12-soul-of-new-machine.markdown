One of my favorite books is [Masters of Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom) (At some point I'll
do a review of that book). I've always tried to find other books that are similar. Someone
in my twitter feed said that if I liked Masters of Doom, I shoul try [The Soul of the new Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine).

This book was published in 1981. Book from the 80s.

What you see if a very early prototype for startups.

I found it interesting how they chased young talent out of school. It was a very different
route then. Instead of spending years working you way up, you were given a lot of
responsibility very early, and you had a lot of say on design. But pay was very low and you
were giving up a lot of your personal time. The gain being stocks.

Not only that but of creating a new technology at such a young age? There seem to be a lot
of prestige around that.

I would say compared to modern startups, Being the first to create something new and interesting.
Sacrificing lots of personal life for financial/technical gains?

What else from the book. Very early look and views on technology. how they views technology
even in the early 80's and how it was going to change things.

Some interesting chapters on design and debugging process.


What I didnt like about the book was there are A LOT of characters. None really get enough time for you
to get invested in them. There are some characters you learn about.

I love the bit about the guy disabling the tvs because he was worried about his kids watching too much
tv, and how he disabled the tvs and told them to try and fix them. I like how he was trying to inspire his
kids into tech but maybe through somewhat evil? means.



What did you like about the book?

What did you hate about the book?

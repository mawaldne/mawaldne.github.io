Im addicted to audible. I listen to a lot of books. I love being able to do things in parallel
while I listen to a book. But sometimes I hear people say "Reading is better for comprehension and you
remember more".

I agree that if you're doing any kind of learning, there needs to be active involvement while you learn. Most of the time this is writing notes or marking things in the book. You can't do this in an audible.

But for me most of my books are entertainment. Its just passive listening for fun and enjoyment.

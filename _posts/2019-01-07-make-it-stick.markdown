I finished my first book of 2019. [Make is stick](https://www.amazon.ca/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013) was recommended to me by my former CTO as one of his favorite books on the subject of learning.

The best quote from the book is “Practice how you play and you’ll play as you practise”.

The main take away for me is if you want to get good at recalling what you learn, you need to stretch your brain in ways to force yourself to try and recall material. Actually work the recalling muscles while you study. A couple of strategies outlines by the book:

1) Testing. Test yourself on material with small quizzes. Ask yourself questions. Have more active learning strategies than just reading material.

2) Spaced repetition and interleaving different concepts. Learn material and have spaced intervals between subsequents review of materials so that you actually exercise recall more.

And finally don’t make things too easy. You need to challenge yourself with the material and try to explain things in your own way. Thats the best way to show you've mastered it.

All in all a really good book!  I highly recommend it.

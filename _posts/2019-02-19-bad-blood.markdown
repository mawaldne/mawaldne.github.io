I finished Bad Blood the other day. All I have to say is - WTF! This is a great book to read and
I couldn't stop listening. I mostly felt really angry and disgusted with the whole situation of Theranos.

It's one thing for a tech company to have problems or scaling issues and you can't check your silly
online posts. It's another thing to give people incorrect information about blood tests and your
doctor makes incorrect diagonosis. There's a line. The complete disregard for peoples health was
horrible.

What was also really depressing is how many people let it happen. The board
of directors had some very big names and there were some very big investors.
But they were all just blinded by personality.
